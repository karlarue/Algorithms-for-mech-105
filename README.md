**Desciption:**
Here you will find all the algorithms I have developed in this class using matlab that deal with numerical problems, such as finding the root, solving for sets of equations and integrating. Methods such as the **false position method**, the **LU factorization method** and the **Simpsons method** were developed to solve these numerical problems.
